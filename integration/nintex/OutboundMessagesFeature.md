The outbound message feature is necessary in order to generate documents automatically (such as at the end of the signature process).  Here is some information on the cost of turning this on with Nintex:

List price for Automated DDPs starts at $0.20 per document generated. This is only in regards to documents that are generated automatically (scheduled/trigger) or in batch.

FAQ Regarding Automated Document Packages

1.       How do we charge for this?

·         Nintex bills up front annually. We will ask you to provide the number of annual auto generated documents you plan on running, in volume intervals of 1,000. Packages of 1,000 are sold for $200 each.

2.       Why is it not “pay-as-you-go?”

·         We do not have the resources to process and bill our customers every time they generate auto documents. We have over 5,000 customers world-wide, and some of these customers generate hundreds of these documents a day, which is a volume that we are unable to support in a “pay-as-you-go” fashion.

3.       What if we go over the amount?

·         We will true up at the time of renewal and bill you for the amount that you went over. We will then work with you to renew at a new number. Most often this new number is the previous amount + the amount you went over.

4.       What happens if we are under?

·         It is essentially “use-it or lose-it.” For this reason, you will want to find the closest annual number estimate.
